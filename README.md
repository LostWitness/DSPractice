# Data Science in practice.

Hello, and welcome to my personal repository with different projects related to classification problems, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning algorithms. Most of them are based on the materials and resources all over the web from highly qualified talented people and data scientists. 

My work experience started a few years ago in Business Intelligence field, specifically in developing and deploying interactive dashboards and applications built under QlikView(Sense)/Power BI software platforms for business users. I am extremely curious about the modern Data Science world, and rich variety of global issues and tasks unsolved. In 2018 I received Bachelor's in Computer Science, and two years later I graduated with Master (hons.) of Big Data Analysis and Machine Learning. Therefore, I decided to delve into the world of data, unstructured pieces of information, which in the end can lead us to useful and exciting hidden details in different forms and shapes.

I am fluent in Russian and proficient in English, with basic knowledge of German.

Resources I personally use: <b>StackOverflow, Medium, TowardsDataScience, Kaggle, Official Documentations</b>.
