# Data Science in practice.

Hello, and welcome to my personal repository with different projects related to classification problems, <b>Natural Language Processing</b>, and <b>Machine Learning</b> algorithms. Most of them are based on the materials and resources all over the web from highly qualified talented people and data scientists. 

My work experience started a few years ago in <b>Business Intelligence</b> field, specifically in developing and deploying interactive dashboards and applications built under QlikView(Sense)/Power BI software platforms for business users. I am extremely curious about the modern Data Science world, and rich variety of global issues and tasks unsolved. In 2018 I received Bachelor's in Computer Science, and two years later I graduated with Master (hons.) of Big Data Analysis and Machine Learning. Therefore, I decided to delve into the world of data, unstructured pieces of information, which in the end can lead us to useful and exciting hidden details in different forms and shapes.

I am fluent in <b>Russian</b> and proficient in <b>English</b>, with basic knowledge of <b>German</b>.

Resources I personally use: <b>StackOverflow, Medium, TowardsDataScience, Kaggle, Official Documentations</b>.
